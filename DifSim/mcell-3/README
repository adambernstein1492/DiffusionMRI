MCell3 Build Requirements:

  1) flex newer than 2.5.6, due to the 'reentrant' option.  Extensive testing
     has been done using Flex 2.5.33.


How To Bootstrap:

  1) When starting from a fresh branch or checkout do:

     ./bootstrap


How To Build:

  1) To build for a given platform do something like this:

     mkdir my_build_dir
     cd my_build_dir
     /path/to/configure CC=gcc CFLAGS='-O3 -march=core2 -Wall -g'
     make


How To Test:

  The test suite is a work in progress.  Right now, there are automated test
  scripts for the "parser" tests, which aim for gross-level feature validation,
  but not strict numeric validation.  Numeric validation tests are soon to
  come.  Once the numeric validation tests have been added, there will be a
  top-level script for running all of the tests (or quick subsets of the tests
  that achieve a reasonable level of coverage without taking too long to run,
  or tests of specific subsystems) will be added to the testsuite directory.

  For the moment, the parser tests can be run in an automated way.  See
  mdl/testsuite/parser/README for details.

  As I bring more of the testsuite online, I'll add a top-level script and
  documentation under the testsuite directory that explains any setup required,
  how to run the testsuite, and subsets of the testsuite which are likely to be
  of interest to various people.
